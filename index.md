# The project

SpeechBrain is a completely open-source and all-in-one speech toolkit relying exclusively on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). The core feature of the project, is to enable the entire speech community to focus on a single, fully customizable, and user-friendly toolkit. SpeechBrain is designed to to develop efficiently any application related to speech, including both end-to-end and DNN/HMM-based speech recognition, speaker identification/verification, self-supervised learning, features extraction, speech augmentation,..., It includes all the tools necessary to develop, benchmark and deploy state-of-the-art speech systems. It also proposes an easy integration of previously trained models on well-known toolkit, such as [PyTorch](http://kaldi-asr.org).

SpeechBrain is currently under development and has just been announced. We expect a lot of news, and a first alpha version in the next few months. For more exciting, and real-time news, please follow the official SpeechBrain twitter!
