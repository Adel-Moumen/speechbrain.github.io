# The project

**SpeechBrain** is an **open-source** **all-in-one** speech toolkit 
relying on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
  
The ambitious goal of the project is to develop a *single*, *flexible*, and *user-friendly* toolkit that can be used to easily develop state-of-the-art speech technologies of different types, including systems for **speech recognition** (both end-to-end and HMM-DNN), **speaker recognition**, **speech separation**, **multi-microphone signal processing** (e.g, beamforming), **self-supervised learning**, **speech contamination/augmentation**,  and many others.
The toolkit will be designed to be a stand-alone framework, but simple interfaces with well-known toolkits, such as [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) will be implemented as well.

**SpeechBrain** is currently **under development** and has just been announced. A first alpha version will be available in the next months.  We plan to build a large community working on this project. Please, go here in you are interested to collaborate.
Stay tuned!
