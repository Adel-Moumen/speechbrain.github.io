# The project

**SpeechBrain** is an **open-source** **all-in-one** speech toolkit 
relying on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
  
The goal is to develop a *single*, *flexible*, and *user-friendly* toolkit that can be used to easily develop state-of-the-art speech technologies of different types, including systems for **speech recognition** (both end-to-end and HMM-DNN), **speaker recognition**, **speech separation**, **multi-microphone signal processing** (e.g, beamforming), **self-supervised learning**, **speech contamination/augmentation**,  and many others.
The toolkit will be designed to be a stand-alone framework, but simple interfaces with well-known toolkits, such as [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) will be implemented as well.

**SpeechBrain** is currently **under development** and has been announced in September, 2019. A first alpha version will be available in the next months.  

Stay tuned!

# How to collaborate
Our goal is to build a large community working on this ambitious project. Feel free to contact us if you are interested to give a contribution.
Thanks to our sponsors, we can hire interns working for 3-6 months at Mila with the core development team.  The ideal candidate is a PhD student with experience on PyTorch and speech technologies.
