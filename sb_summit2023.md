SpeechBrain has established itself as a leading deep learning toolkit for speech processing in recent years, with impressive usage statistics to back it up. With an average of 100 daily clones and 1000 daily downloads on its GitHub repository, along with over 5,258 stars and 1000 forks, SpeechBrain is a popular choice among speech processing experts. 

In this summit, we are excited to share the latest developments and updates on the SpeechBrain project, engage in an open and collaborative discussion with the community, and introduce it to a broader audience of speech professionals. We would like participants to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements made in SpeechBrain and speech processing technology. We also wish to gather, more interactively, the feedback from the community to better plan future developments. The event will take place four days after the main conference on August 28th.


We are passionate about organizing this event for several reasons:

* The field of speech technology has seen tremendous growth in recent years. Our goal is to keep the community informed about the latest developments and future plans for the SpeechBrain project. We also aim to engage in an open dialogue with the community to set ambitious goals for the project's future.
* We are excited to bring together experts from both industry and academia to showcase their impactful projects and share their knowledge with the community.
* This event is not only an opportunity to learn and stay updated, but also to network and connect with like-minded individuals in the SpeechBrain community. The core idea is to avoid missing this chance to be a part of shaping the future of speech technologies and building valuable connections within the community.
